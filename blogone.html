<h1>The First of Way Too Many</h1>
<h4>15/10/2019</h4>

<p>
    <br>   
        So this class (Web 503) has been a bit of a struggle for me this semester. Our first tutor was a lovely man, however he couldn’t teach for shit. Personally I think he was 
        thrown in the deep end and may have been a fair bit autistic and therefore struggled to stand up in front of the class and teach us (really made me feel for him, there’s no 
        way in hell i could do it either). A lot of complaining went on but of course no one actually went and made a formal complaint until I went and talked to the course coordinator
        myself and told her what was going on. All this lead to was having a member of staff sit in on our classes for about 20 minutes and observe what was going on. It was a fairly
        useless gesture in my opinion.
          <br> <br>
        Classes carried on with most of us not knowing our hands from our asses and those few students who were lucky enough to have previous knowledge on the subject attempted to
        help those who asked for it.
         <br> <br>
         Towards the end of term we were received an email stating that our humble tutor would be leaving us in two weeks time. This was meet with mixed reactions. Some were glad to
          be rid of the useless tutors, others wondered what would become of us and if we would ever possibly be able to pass the course. THANKFULLY a wonderful tutor with loads of 
          experience picked up the class and thus began proper introduction to web coding. FINALLY!!!
        <br> <br>
        During the two week break from class I attended a catch up class held by our wonderful new tutor. I was blown away.
        Usually in web class students would be there no longer than two hours, and the previous tutor would be there less than that. It was a sham, a damn disgrace.
        <br> <br>
        This tutor however kept me engaged the whole five (yes five!) hours that I was there. I learnt more in those five hours than I had the entire previous term. I was given advice,
         games to play that would help with learning multiple areas of web coding, and online tutorials to take. During the last week of break i made my way through some of the games 
         and tutorials, finally expanding my knowledge and feeling like I was getting somewhere. It was FANTASTIC!

         So now, first week back from break, only 4 weeks left of classes and I’ve lit a proverbial fire under my ass so as to get myself up to speed, and start/complete my site for 
         assessment 3 (as well as study for the upcoming theory test).

         <br> <br>
         I was also informed that I am required to make a few (too many) blog posts documenting my gainful knowledge and such. So basically I’m just going to write down a load of waffle 
         and whinge about my many struggles while i attempt to code a damn good website, which is also going to be full of pure waffle and cute doggo pics.
         <br> <br>
         Sooooo ahh yeah, enjoy friends cause Imma write some shit.
