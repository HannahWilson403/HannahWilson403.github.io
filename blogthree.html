<h1>"I'm sure there's an english teacher dying somewhere over the amount of 'ands'
    that I have used in this post" - Hannah Wilson </h1>

            Sooooooo, after an hour or two of faffing about I have finally got the bare bones of my website looking 
            how I want (boring as heck and not at all flashy I know). It’s taken two cups of tea and multiple pee 
            breaks but here we are.
            <br> <br>
            Now begins the struggle of possibly creating a gallery (no Idea how it will go) for photos of my plants 
            and doggo. Knowing me I’ll probably give up and do it the easy way cause I’m a lazy shit and its 1.00am 
            and I want to go to bed.
            <br> <br>
            Yes, Ali I’m sure you’re disappointed in me but so am i. and so is my mother (I actually don’t know if 
            she is, she probably couldn’t give two shits). Alas next year I will make sure I crack into assignments 
            earlier and work harder but for now I just want to get this year over with, it has been waaay too trying 
            and too many crappy things have happened. <br>I just need a break. Only a wee one. For naps and reading and 
            stuff. Also, for beach times with doggos because watching them chase birds and splash in the sea makes me 
            feel happy. 
            <br> <br>
            Righto, on with the struggle. I’m sure I will get there, I just need another cup of tea (or three) and then 
            I shall crack into it.
            <br> <br>
            Gunna be peeing all night long!!!
